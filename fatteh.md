## Fatteh
A Lebanese breakfast/snack dish.
Can be caught in the wild in Turkey, and in my kitchen.

## Ingredients
Serves: 4  

- 1.5 cups plain yogurt (full fat is better, but not necessary)
- 1 18oz pack of toasted pita chips
- 1 tsp Avocado oil (or any cooking oil with minimal flavor)
- 1/2 tsp (generous) ground cumin
- 1/2 tsp paprika
- 1 15oz can garbanzo beans (chickpeas), rinsed, drained  
- Chopped fresh parsley  
- Fresh lime juice (optional)

## Directions

- Heat oil in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat  
- Add chickpeas, salt and saute for ~2 minutes and set aside
- Spread the toasted chips out in a tray/bowl that you will serve in (preferably as flat and shallow as possible)
- Add cumin, salt and paprika to 1.5 cups of plain yogurt and beat it until it attains a creamy, homogenous texture
- Layer chickpeas over the bed of pita chips in your serving bowl
- Top this stack with spiced yogurt and spread as evenly as possible.
- Sprinkle chopped parsley liberally and serve / devour

### Variations

- You _could_ add lime juice to fatteh. Depending on what you appreciate, the overall flavor may come off as too tangy, considering we already have so much yogurt in the mix
- If you like it spicy, consider adding other spices to the yogurt. Intuitively, ground coriander should work well. Possibly even khmeli-suneli. Maybe open a ticket if this leads to surprises
