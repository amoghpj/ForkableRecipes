## Ingredients
1. Dough - 16oz pizza dough or DIY
  1. All purpose flour
    - 3 cups
  2. Olive oil
    - 1/3 cup
  3. Yeast
    - 1 tsp
  4. Sugar
    - 1 tbsp
  5. Salt
    - 1/2 to 1 tsp
  6. Water
    - 1 1/3 cup warm water
2. Spinach
   - 2 cups
3. Artichokes, chopped
   - 1 can
4. Olive oil
   - 2 tbsp for spinach, 1 tbsp for tofu filling
5. Nutritional yeast (optional)
   - 1/3 cup
6. Firm tofu
   - 1 block
7. Salt
   - 1 tsp
8. Chilli pepper flakes
## Directions
1. Cook the spinach in oil for 5 minutes, set aside.
2. Squeeze the water out of the tofu. The drier the better.
3. Blend the tofu, nutritional yeast, salt, olive oil in a blender.
4. Lay the dough out on the work surface, about a foot by a foot-and-a-half. Use a rolling pin to make the layer thin.
5. Spread the tofu filling generously and evenly over the dough.
6. Spread the cooked spinach and chopped artichokes evenly. 
7. Roll the dough to form a tight roll. Use a sharp knife to cut 1.5 inch wheels. This will be messy as the tofu tends to get squeezed out, but don't stress about it!
8. Grease a baking sheet with olive oil, and lay the rolls touching each other. 
9. Bake at 425 for 35-40 minutes or until the surface of the bread starts to brown a little.
10. Serve with your favorite dip!
### Variations
- The tofu can be as plain or flavorful as you want it to be. I've experimented with and without the nutritional yeast, they both work. There is a lot of room to experiment with adding spices here.
