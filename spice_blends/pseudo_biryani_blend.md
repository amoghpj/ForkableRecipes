## Pseudo Biryani Spice Blend
Pseudo, because I'm vegetarian and my version of a biryani will forever be a facsimile.
That said, this blend is fairly versatile and modular. It can go on anything that you want it to go on.

## Ingredients
This gives enough to add to a portion of biryani/rice that serves about 6.
It has good shelf life, so you're better off erring on the side of excess while preparing the blend, and using only as much as needed.
- 1 1-inch long Cinnamon stick
- 2 Star Anise
- 1.5 tbsp Fennel
- 0.5 tbsp Black pepper (not crushed)
- 1 pod of Cardamom
- 3-4 Dried red chili
- 2 cloves
- 2 Bay leaves
- 1 tbsp coriander seeds
- 1 tbsp cumin seeds

## Directions
- Set bay leaves aside
- Dry roast every thing else one at a time until each releases a strong aroma
(be careful not to burn)
- Grind all roasted ingredients together into a fine powder
- Use this powder to spice your dish and add bay leaves while it cooks

### Variations
- Dry roasting is a great time to decide whether or not you want to skip on certain flavors. If you do not enjoy the smell of a certain spice while it heats up, skip adding it to the blend.
