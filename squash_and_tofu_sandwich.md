## Ingredients

1. 2 slices of bread
2. Squash (the pumpkin kind) - kabocha, buttercup etc
3. Firm tofu
4. 4 tbsp Tamari / Soy sauce
5. 1 tbsp Sesame oil
6. 2 tbsp Olive oil
7. 1 clove garlic (minced)
8. Nutritional yeast
9. Salt
10. Black pepepr
11. Mayonnaise
12. Pickled vegetables (cabbage, beets, carrots, anything)

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 400F
2. Cut the squash in two, get rid of the seeds and memberane, chop it into thin slices (like you would slice an apple)
3. On a baking sheet lined with parchment, spread the squash slices out
4. Add olive oil, nutritional yeast, salt and pepper. Toss everything around for even coating
5. Roast in the oven for 20min
6. Meanwhile, mix the tamari, sesame oil and garlic in a bowl to form a marinade
7. Gently squeeze the tofu with a paper towel to get as much water out as possible
8. Cut tofu into thin slices and marinate them (I do this by dipping them in the marinade and setting them on a baking sheet)
9. Roast the tofu for 20min
10. Toast 2 slices of bread, spread mayonnaise
11. Assemble slices of tofu and squash and top of it off with pickled vegetables to build your sandwich

### Variations

1. You can add cayenne to the squash before toasting
2. Instead of mayo, you could use yogurt with garlic and lemon juice as a spread. Tahini is another option
3. Toast your bread in butter for extra crispiness
