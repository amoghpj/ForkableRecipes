## Borscht
Borscht is a sweet/sour soup common in Eastern Europe, presumably originating in Ukranian cuisine.
This recipe makes no claims of being authentic, but I think it touches on most features of canonized borscht.
I've seen no proper consensus on the 't' in the name. Welp.

## Ingredients  
The core of the soup really comes from beetroot, potatoes, dill and sour cream. Everything else is somewhat negotiable.

Serves 3 people:

- 1 Red Beetroot
- 2 Potatoes
- 1 smallish/medium yellow Onion
- 1 Carrot (completely optional)
- 1/4 Cabbage
- 1.25 l of water
- 2 Cloves of garlic (or used store-bought chopped ones)
- 1 tbsp Sunflower oil
- 1.5 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp ground coriander
- Salt and Black pepper

Toppings:
- Chopped dill, sour cream

## Directions
- Salt the water mildly to boil in a big pot (big enough that the water fills half of it)
- Peel and chop the beetroot, carrot and potatoes to bite sized pieces
- Separate the cabbage leaves and chop them to a medium size (~1/4 the surface area of the pot)
- Finely chop the onions
- Add the potatoes and beetroot to the water when it has come to a boil
- Heat sunflower oil in a pan, and fry the onions, carrots and garlic until the onions are golden brown
- Add contents of the pan into the pot
- Season it with cumin, coriander, salt, pepper and bring the mixture to a boil
- Add cabbage leaves then let it simmer for ~20min or until all the vegetables are soft
- Serve it hot with a topping of sour cream and chopped dill

### Variations
- You could add mayonnaise instead of sour cream. Worth keeping in mind that it will get mildly poached when added to hot soup. Personally, I like that.
- I recently tried this with store-bought Sriracha Mayonnaise (lol) and that was a pleasant surprise
- I've seen borscht recipes with kidney beans. This is worth a shot.
